Backbone Tyler
===============

Backbone.Tyler allows you to have declarative composite views in your backbone apps. Dependencies: require.js, Backbone and Handlebars.js. Tyler is inspired by what Soundcloud have been doing with Next (http://backstage.soundcloud.com/2012/06/building-the-next-soundcloud/).
